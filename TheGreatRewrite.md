# Semantic Hearing Rewrite 

The purpose of this document is to rewrite  the Semantic Hearing paper by Bandhav Veluri and Malek Itani. The original paper can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586183.3606779). The code for the original paper can be found [here](https://github.com/vb000/SemanticHearing). The code written by Veluri is difficult to understand and utlizes a lot of end-of-life libraries. The purpose of this rewrite is to make the code more readable and to update the libraries used in the original code.
